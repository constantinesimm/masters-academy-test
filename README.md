## Shop Stocktaking

Create a function that receives the array of goods and returns the cost that should be paid for all these goods.
Your code should:
- Validate the data according to the following rules: item: string,  type: string, weight: number, quantity: number, pricePerKilo: `“$” + number` - string,  pricePerItem: `“$” + number` - string
- Print to the console the total quantity of all watermelons (`Watermelons - ${quantity}`);
- Print to the console the total weight of all apples (`Apples - ${weight}`);
- Sort the array in alphabetical order by item field and print it to the console;
- Sort the array by cost of the record and print it to the console;
- Print to the terminal the type of oranges with the least price (`The cheapest orange type is: ${type}`);
- Print to the console the cost of the goods by item name (`Apples - ${costApples}, Pineapples - ${costPineapples}, Watermelons - ${costWatermelons}, Oranges - ${costOranges}`);
- Print to the console the result of the execution of this function.


Note: Try to minimize your code.
